# Housing-Price-Prediction
A Random Forest model for predicting housing prices using scikit-learn

# Housing Price Prediction using Random Forest
This project uses a Random Forest Regression model to predict housing prices based on various features. The dataset was preprocessed and a Random Forest model was trained and evaluated using scikit-learn.

## Approach
- Data was cleaned and preprocessed.
- Feature scaling was applied to normalize the data.
- Random Forest Regresssor was used to model the relationship between features and housing prices.

## Results
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) :
  0.32
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) :
  0.26
- R - squared (R^2) :
  0.80

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
